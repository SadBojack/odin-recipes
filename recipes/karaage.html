        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With juicy marinated chicken coated in an ultra-crisp shell, <strong>Karaage</strong> is a staple of Japanese home-cooking and one of the most popular items to pack into a <em>bento box lunch</em> in Japan.</p>
        <p>To the east of <em>Osaka</em>, there is a river called <em>Tastutagawa</em>, which is famous for the beautiful autumn foliage surrounding it. When chicken is marinated in soy sauce before being coated in starch and fried, it turns the color of <em>autumn leaves</em>, which is how <em>Tastutaage</em> is said to have gotten its name. By this definition, what most of us know as <strong>Karaage</strong> is technically <strong>Tastutaage</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sake</li>
            <li>25 grams fresh ginger (grated)</li>
            <li>900 grams boneless skin-on chicken thighs (cut into bite-size pieces)</li>
            <li>170 grams potato starch</li>
            <li>vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>lemon (sliced into wedges for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the soy sauce, sake and ginger together in a bowl to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and mix well to ensure each piece of chicken is coated with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate, allowing the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to fry the karaage, add 1 inch of vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed pot and heat until the oil reaches 340 degrees F (170 C). Prepare a paper towel-lined rack.</li>
            <li>While you wait for the oil to come up to temperature, dredge the marinated chicken in potato starch to coat each piece evenly and set the pieces of coated chicken on a tray.</li>
            <li>When the oil ready, fry the coated chicken in batches. Don't overcrowd the pot, and I recommend batching pieces of chicken that are roughly the same size.</li>
            <li>When the karaage hits an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (71 C), transfer them to the prepared rack and let them rest for a few minutes before serving them.
