        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thinly sliced beef and tender onions cooked in savory-sweet sauce, <strong>Gyudon</strong>, or Japanese Beef Rice Bowl, is synonymous with comfort. It has been a staple in Japanese cuisine for over 150 years! It's a perfect quick meal for a busy weeknight!</p>
        <p>The name <strong>gyudon</strong> was coined by <em>Eikichi Matsuda</em> in the late 1800s. Matsuda is the owner of Japan's most famous Tokyo-based, beef bowl chain, <em>Yoshinoya</em>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
            <li>1/2 lb thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon mirin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 servings steamed white rice</li>
            <li>pickled red ginger</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, thinly slice the onion.
            </li>
            <li>Next, cut the green onions diagonally into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Then, take out the meat from the freezer. Cut the sliced meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add the dashi, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Next, add the onion slices and spread them throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.</li>
            <li>Then, add the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid and start cooking over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>When the meat is cooked, skim off the scum and fat from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer. Turn down the heat to simmer and continue cooking, covered, for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. If you like to add beaten eggs, you can add at this step.</li>
            <li>In a large donburi bowl, add the steamed rice and drizzle the remaining sauce on top.
            </li>
            <li>Put the beef and onion mixture on top. If you'd like, drizzle the remaining sauce on top. Top with the pickled red ginger. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
