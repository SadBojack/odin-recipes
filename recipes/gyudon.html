                    <li>3 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 servings steamed white rice</li>
                    <li>pickled red ginger</li>

            <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="contents">
                <li>First, thinly slice the onion.
                </li>
                <li>Next, cut the green onions diagonally into thin slices.</li>
                <li>Then, take out the meat from the freezer. Cut the sliced meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
                <li>In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add the dashi, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Next, add the onion slices and spread them throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.</li>
                <li>Then, add the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.</li>
                <li>Cover the pan with a lid and start cooking over medium heat.
                </li>
                <li>When the meat is cooked, skim off the scum and fat from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer. Turn down the heat to simmer and continue cooking, covered, for 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. If you like to add beaten eggs, you can add at this step.</li>
                <li>In a large donburi bowl, add the steamed rice and drizzle the remaining sauce on top.
                </li>
                <li>Put the beef and onion mixture on top. If you'd like, drizzle the remaining sauce on top. Top with the pickled red ginger. Enjoy!</li>
